There is a large setup violation of -2.474 ns between design_1_i/perceptron_0/inst/WEIGHT_MEMORY/bram/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[0].ram.r/prim_noinit.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.TRUE_DP.SIMPLE_PRIM36.ram/CLKBWRCLK (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/perceptron_0/inst/mult/U0/i_mult/gDSP.gDSP_only.iDSP/use_prim.appDSP48[1].bppDSP48[1].use_dsp.use_dsp48e1.iDSP48E1/PCIN[6] (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

ULMTCS-1#1 Warning
Control Sets use limits recommend reduction  
This design uses 377 control sets (vs. available limit of 4400, determined by 1 control set per CLB). This exceeds the control set use guideline of 7.5 percent. This is at a level where reduction is RECOMMENDED (see UG949). Use report_control_sets to get more details.
